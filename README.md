Tiny 80's-style RPG engine in Love2D.

Final goal is to make one fully featured five floor dungeon. 

Functional:
- Exploring maps.
- Basic events, text boxes, locked doors and keys.
- Battle system, leveling.
- Random encounters, resting.

To implement:
- Enemies can miss, running can fail.
- Find STR Seed, Health Seed, Bronze/Iron/Silver Swords on map to raise STR.
- Draw maps and place events in Ogmo. This is the last step, then this is an engine I can really use.

Polish steps after making an actual game:
- Make Game Over'ing functional.
- Transitions between maps.
- Title screen.
- Save and Load menu.
